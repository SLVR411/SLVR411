 ðŸ‘‹Hey, I'm Schroeder

Welcome to my GitHub. I am a student who is studying Computer Technology in JKUAT- one project at a time. I began with CS50, in which I have been studying the basics in the form of hands-on assignments, debugging marathons, and real-world problems.

 ðŸš€Projects You'll See Here

-CS50 Problem Sets - Solving problem sets in C and Python that enhanced my logic.

-English Level Detector - it is an analysis of sentences, which determines the level of writing skills.

-Currently working on Matatu Fare Logger (Final Project WIP) - to monitor movements with support of M-Pesa in the future.

 ðŸ”§Tech Stack

-Languages C, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript (learning stage)

-Tools : Linux Mint, Git/GitHub, VS code

-Areas of Focus: Networking solutions, Web Development, Algorithms.

 ðŸŽ¯Next Moves

-Dabbling in calculus and discrete math to fine-tune problem-solving abilities.

-Expanding in AI, software development, and hardware-technology crossover development.
 
 âš¡I did not come to simply utilize technology. I came to know it, break it, reconstruct it--and move it further!
